        <p>This all began as a project for a 24 hour Hackathon. However, 24 hours just wasn’t enough for me. I wanted to go full UX on the idea. So here’s where I ended up.</p>
        <p>Hope you enjoy.</p>
        <h1>Role in Project</h1>
        <p>UX/UI Design, User Research, Prototyping, <br>Usability Testing, Competitive Analysis</p>
        <h1>Duration</h1>
        <p>6 weeks (February-March 2019)<br> Part-Time</p>

          <h1 class="first-screen-title">How it started</h1>
          <p>Given the task of tackling sustaible health my team and I came up with the idea of taking on the challenge of take out container waste. After the 24 hour period we had a cute XD prototype that had some features but I wasn’t satisfied. I wanted to go full UX on this sh** so this is where I landed.</p>
          <h1>Why I continued</h1>
          <p>As much as we like to think we are sustainable gurus here in Vancouver I am sad to say, we most certainly are not.</p>

      <h2>Ideation Process: The Hackathon</h3>
      <p>At XD Hacks that took place at the University of British Columbia February 9-10 2019, my team and I took task of tackling current problems facing the Global Resources & Foods Path. We came up with the idea of tackling the disposable container problem as it is extremely prevalent in Vancouver.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>My Team</h2>
      <p>Brian Cheng - UX Designer and GIS Specialist</p>
      <p>Jasmine L - Biology Majoy at UBC</p>
      <h1>What we achieved after 24 hours</h2>
      <p>Brian made this in 3 hours, he also did all of the prototyping to display our protoype to the judges (pretty impressive!). Check out his work at designsbybrian.ca</p>
      <img>
      <p>I made the onboarding, logo, and worked on the slide deck with Jasmine</p>
      <img>
      <p>Jasmine researched the feasibility of the project nd created an implemenation plan that we pitched to the judges.</p>
    </div>


    <p class="content-break-text">After the 24 hour hackathon period, I was super stoked on the idea and decided to take it to the next level by implementing user research and stronger visual design.</p>

      <h2>Design Process</h3>
      <p>Organizing a hierarchy of information was critical for ReBox. Continued research and iteration was crucial to understanding users and how to best tailor ReBox to their needs and motivations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <h1>Step 1: Survey's and Interviews</h2>
      <p>In order to get to know my users better I created a survey with 20 respondents and conducted interviews with 5 individuals. I find this to be a good jumping off point for user research as it gives you some idea towards general tendencies and opinions. It allowed me to focus my efforts on delving into users habits on a much narrower scope. The general things that I was trying to identify was who ReBox’s users were; their habits, age, motivations, core needs and pain points. Ultimately this phase helped me figure out what my early adopter target market looked like.</p>
