        <p>This is a question many university students find asking themselves as they near the end of their degree. Competition is fierce and with an estimated 1.7M students enrolled in postsecondary education it can often feel overwhelming trying to find your place in this cold world. (brr)</p>
        <p>Interviews are the ultimate question of ones value. How do you sell yourself? How do you convince someone that they should pay you money and invest time in you?  How do you stand out against the thousands of other applicants?


        If you decide to keep reading I am going to answer those for you. Well, try to at least.</p>

          <p class="title-paragraph">The ultimate interview prep mobile app. Interview U allows you to hone your skills so you can start making the big bucks!</p>
          <p>One of the best ways to improve in all aspects of expression whether it be athletic, vocal or perforamce is to record yourself. This premise is what kicked off the project. There are no real metrics to know how you did in interviews, you either get the job or you don’t.</p>
          <p>In order to mitigate this pain point and help thousands get tangible feedback on their performance came the idea of Interview U: the app that allows playback and saving your responses to questions in order to see areas of improvement.</p>

                <p>Paper prototyping was an incredibly valuable exercise to really work out the flow of my app. It became evident that there was too many functions. User Testing provided a lot of insights as to the layout of my wireframes and additional features that would aid in the ease of use of my app. It was mentioned that there were too many features including both parties: interviewer and interviewee.</p>

            <h2>Officehours.io session with Eric Karjaluoto</h2>

            <div class="interview-content">
              <div class="interview-paragraphs">
                <p>Through the use of officehours.io I was given the incredible opportunity to speak with industry expert and founder of officehours.io, Eric Karjaluoto regarding my project (officehours.io is an incredible resource for getting insight, feedback and advice). As my app was initially going to be a similar setup to officehours.io itself, Eric was an invaluable resource and provided me with some extremely important insights. After briefly explaining my concept Eric pointed out that while it’s a good idea it is incredibly difficult to convey value to the target audience. He encouraged me to narrow my target audience from University students even further. Eric pointed out that if you are able to convey value to a specific target audience first, you can always grow later. From this feedback I decided to narrow down my target audience from University to Commerce students; with the possibility of even narrowing it down further pending user testing.</p>
                <p>The next piece of knowledge Eric imparted on me was that users want the easiest experience possible. My initial idea was too complex and that by looking for ways to simplify it could greatly increase its potential for success. Eric mentioned that one of the biggest barriers I would face is having both parties show up for interviews. It is important to look at the demographic and if it’s already difficult to have them talk on the phone, having them consistently show up for scheduled FaceTime interviews would be quite a challenge. Individuals expectations are very high. In this situation with setting up meetings between two parties there is a large amount of room for let down expectations. Essentially it’s a huge opportunity for disappointment from users having their practice interviews cancelled or the other party not showing up. From this he asked me to consider potentially taking some of the tech aspects out of it and looking for ways to encourage students to meet in real life, potentially have scheduled phone calls, bring the interview to the user or have university groups that are compulsory. Eric really made me consider my projects solution in an entirely different light. I have decided to take the FaceTime aspect out of my app and I am currently pursuing how I might integrate these into my app to make it a much better user experience.</p>

                <p>Eric also asked me to consider the feedback I was receiving. From his experience feedback like “oh that sounds cool” and “that’d be nice to have” may in theory be good ideas but in execution are not always successful. Despite something sounding nice it is really important to be able to actually deliver an experience that seamlessly fits into users busy lives. It is important to take time to reflect on the idea itself and narrow down the specific interview skills people really need and focus on those.</p>
                <p>Key Takeaways
      •Narrow down target audience.
      •Keep it focused.
      •Is there an easier way to do it?
