        <p>This is a question many university students find asking themselves as they near the end of their degree. Competition is fierce and with an estimated 1.7M students enrolled in postsecondary education it can often feel overwhelming trying to find your place in this cold world. (brr)</p>
        <p>Interviews are the ultimate question of ones value. How do you sell yourself? How do you convince someone that they should pay you money and invest time in you?  How do you stand out against the thousands of other applicants?


        If you decide to keep reading I am going to answer those for you. Well, try to at least.</p>

          <p>One of the best ways to improve in all aspects of expression whether it be athletic, vocal or perforamce is to record yourself. This premise is what kicked off the project. There are no real metrics to know how you did in interviews, you either get the job or you don’t.</p>
          <p>In order to mitigate this pain point and help thousands get tangible feedback on their performance came the idea of Interview U: the app that allows playback and saving your responses to questions in order to see areas of improvement.</p>
